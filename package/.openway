v1.0.0: kR "package_key_1" // ! replace this password !

/*
WELCOME TO OPENWAY

This file controls releases of your package.
By default, init (v1.0.0) is secured using 'kR' (key restriction).
There is a very simple password by default which is intended to be changed.

You can access your Openway package in the tests/main.py file.
Make sure you have Openway installed (gavel install openway --get-packages)
